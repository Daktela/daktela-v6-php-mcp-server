Review call transcripts from the {{period}}{{user_clause}}.

Use list_call_transcripts to get calls with their transcripts. For each call, analyze:

1. **Customer escalation** — did the customer ask for a manager or express strong dissatisfaction?
2. **Product knowledge gaps** — did the agent struggle to answer questions or give incorrect info?
3. **Unmet commitments** — did the agent promise a callback, follow-up, or resolution that may not have happened?
4. **Positive examples** — exceptional handling, great de-escalation, or upsell opportunities

For each flagged call, provide:
- Call ID and agent name
- Duration and direction (inbound/outbound)
- Category of finding
- Key quote from the transcript
- Coaching recommendation

At the end, summarize:
- Total calls reviewed
- Breakdown by category
- Top coaching priorities per agent
